### Welcome to my profile:

-----

Hello there. I'm Jordan. I have been programming for a very long time.

Is this my job? No. Just a hobby at the moment. Maybe it will be someday. Or, at least I hope it will be.

My only hope is that my work has given you knowledge and helped you along the way.

### Preamble:

-----

I primarily program in Fortran now. Along with C and LuaJIT. It's a comfy bundle.

All of my Fortran libraries are dogfooded. They are written for myself, used by myself, and I would like to share them.

If you like what I do, and would like to support me: [My Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jordan4ibanez)

If patreon isn't what you'd like, suggest things to me. Patreon is all I really know at the moment.
