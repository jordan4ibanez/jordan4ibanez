## Hello there!

I'm Jordan.

### Preamble:

I primarily program in Fortran now. Along with C and LuaJIT. It's a comfy bundle.

All of my Fortran libraries are dogfooded to myself because they are written for myself and I would like to share them.

If you like what I do, and would like to support me: [My Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/jordan4ibanez)
