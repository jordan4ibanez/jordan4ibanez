## Hello there! Nice to meet ya. 8)

I am jordan4ibanez. I like making games. I find programming and architectural design of engines/systems fun!

Programming is my hobby. I am self-taught with a TON of googling.

A little bit about me: I started off in the [Minetest project](https://github.com/minetest/minetest) as a modder. I am very thankful for Minetest for giving me my head start into programming. I would specifically like to thank Sfan5 and Jeija. They literally taught me how to use the print function when I first became a programmer, and I am forever grateful. Every time I open up one of my games with a new feature I am always brought back to the mental space of trying out my very old paintings mod (which you can see a picture of [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jordan4ibanez/jordan4ibanez/main/images/classic.png)) for the first time. I truly enjoy programming.

I am currently working on [Crafter](https://github.com/jordan4ibanez/Crafter-Java). I'm taking it slow, so I can really feel out how I want it to go.

You can talk to my directly [on my Discord.](https://discord.gg/dRPyvubfyg) Be warned: I ramble a lot! :P

Let's see here...

I know a few programming languages

1. Common Lisp
2. Elisp
3. D
4. C++
5. Rust
6. Nim
7. Lua
8. Dart
9. Java
10. Kotlin
11. Go

This had a bunch of ideas on how to get started writing this. One of them was  "currently learning", but I think I'm always learning. Learning is very important!

Fun fact: I am called jordan4ibanez because my name is Jordan, and my first guitar was an Ibanez RG120! So my name literally means Jordan (4/for) Ibanez. I like Ibanez and Gibson. :)
