### Welcome to my profile:

-----

Hello there. I'm Jordan. I have been programming for a very long time.

Is this my job? No. Just a hobby at the moment. Maybe it will be someday. Or, at least I hope it will be.

My only hope is that my work has given you knowledge and helped you along the way.

### Things that are evaluated at compile time:

#### From: schveiguy

The following expressions are evaluated at compile time:
Initializers for static, module-level, or __gshared variables

1. value of an enum.
2. A template value argument.
3. default initializers for member fields.
4. And that's it. Everything else is runtime.
